# Java Chess Game

The game is part of a course. Therefore, most of the code was not made 
by me. Still, I made some changes when I saw things that could have done 
in a way I would have liked more. It is quite a nice game, actually. It 
implements everything you have in a regular chess game, even special 
moves. Again, not my code. Probably this repository is 
going down any time soon, when I start to create my own projects.
